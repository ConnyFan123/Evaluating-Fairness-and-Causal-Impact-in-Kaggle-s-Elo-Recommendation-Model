# ðŸ“Š Responsible Data Science Audit:
## Evaluating Fairness and Causal Impact in Kaggleâ€™s Elo Recommendation Model

This project audits a solution to the [ELO Merchant Category Recommendation](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/elo-merchant-category-recommendation) competition on Kaggle.  
We specifically focus on the notebook ["Elo World"](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fabiendaniel/elo-world) by Fabien Daniel (Kaggle user: `fabiendaniel`), a high-performing approach using credit card transaction history and merchant features to predict loyalty scores.

### Project Goals

- Evaluate model **accuracy**, **stability**, and **fairness** across subpopulations.
- Apply **causal inference techniques** (e.g., pre-post analysis, control-treatment comparison) to assess promotional targeting impact.
- Interpret model behavior using **SHAP** and **LIME** for global and local explanations.
- Propose improvements to data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering for responsible deployment.
